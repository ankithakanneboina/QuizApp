Even though it’s a small project, it covers core front-end concepts that every developer must know:

DOM Manipulation:
You learned how to dynamically change the content of a webpage — updating questions, options, and scores using JavaScript.

Event Handling:
You handled user interactions — clicks on options and the “Next” button — to make the app interactive.

Conditional Logic & Loops:
You used JavaScript logic to check correct answers, loop through the questions, and calculate the score.

Array & Object Handling:
You structured questions and answers using arrays/objects, a fundamental part of real app development.

State Management:
You learned how to keep track of the current question index and user score — a basic version of managing state in web apps.

Dynamic UI Rendering:
You dynamically generated HTML (questions, options) using JavaScript — a concept used in frameworks like React or Vue later on.

CSS Styling & Layout:
You improved your sense of UI by designing buttons, spacing, and layout for a pleasant user experience.

🧩 Soft Skills Recruiters Notice

Building this app by yourself shows:

Initiative — You didn’t just copy; you figured out how to make it work your way.

Curiosity — You explored logic and user interaction instead of sticking to static websites.

Problem-solving — You debugged small logic errors and learned how to test and fix them.

Persistence — You completed a working project end-to-end.

Recruiters love developers who finish what they start — even small projects.
